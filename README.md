# Skin-DiseaseDetection

Developed a deep learning model for image-based skin disease
detection with 89% accuracy using CNN and TensorFlow.
Implemented data augmentation and tf datasets for enhanced
model performance.
Project goal includes integrating with a mobile app to enable
disease detection from user-uploaded images (future
development planned for backend, optimization, and
deployment).
